# Quitting_Tomorrow
This is an iOS app called "Quitting Tomorrow."  Simply put, the app allows users to release work-related stress daily by expressing their emotions. It features a button with a counter function. The logic is that if a user clicks the button too many times in a day, it indicates a strong desire to quit their job.
